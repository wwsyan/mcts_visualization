# MCTS_visualization
An implementation of visualizing Monte Carlo Tree Search 

Require: <code>pip install pygame</code>

Run <code>run.py</code> to play.

## Enviroment
It's a simplified version of an old Chinese chess.
<ul>
<li>When chess A jump over chess B, B will be removed.</li>
<li>The fewer chess left, the higher the score get.</li>
</ul>

## Algorithm
**Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** is a classic planning algorithm applied in Alphago and AlphaZero.
In this case, a pure MCTS (without value evaluation network) is used but still effective to solve the problem.

## Visualization logic
<ul>
<li>Child nodes inherit the color of the parent node.</li>
<li>Nodes at the same search depth are rendered in the same line.</li>
</ul>
